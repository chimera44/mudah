  <p>"muta" or renaldo moon is the supporting character in the movie "The cat returns" by studio ghibli. Renaldo moon is a notorious criminal who gained a reputation for devouring a whole lake of fish at one time. And then running away. His tale is etched into places of worship in the cat kingdom to remember the horrible event. Brash and grumpy, Muta is known for his unchecked sense of sarcasm and condescension towards people and his other companions, and for his huge appetite. This accounted for his chagrined relationship with Toto, whom he has a mutual dislike with, though they wouldn't hesitate to team up and work together when the need arises. In spite of his seeming indifference, he did eventually warm up to Haru, whom he praised for standing up for herself and later aided in her escape from the Cat Realm. </p>
